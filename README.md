Guz is a small personal assistant based on a multi-agent system and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain and LangGraph, designed to accurately respond to queries about me.  
So far, it has access to 2 documents with dense information about me and several of my projects.

> I am still in the process of exploring how to optimize retrieval and how documents should be organized for the best results so some information about me might be missing or slightly innacurate.
